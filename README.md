ML-based Django app predicting weather with historical data and interactive visualizations.
# Weather Forecasting Prediction with ML

## Project Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning-based weather forecasting system** built using **Django**. It predicts weather conditions like temperature, humidity, and rainfall based on historical data. The system also provides visualizations to make trends easy to understand.

## Features
- Predicts weather conditions using ML algorithms.
- User-friendly interface built with Django.
- Visualizes weather trends and predictions.
- Can be extended with more datasets for better accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Django
- Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
